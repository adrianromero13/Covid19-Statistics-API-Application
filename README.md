# Covid-19 Global Tracker

## Description

This simple data tracker application was designed to illustrate data on the treacherous virus pandemic that has been spreading in a global level since January of 2020.
The application focuses on the overall **infected**, number of **recoveries**, and the number of **deaths** caused by the spread of the Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2). It illustrates the data into a visual of numbers and an interactive chart for the global data on the **three** topics of information. 
This information is updated daily as of November 2, 2020. 

## Purpose

The main goal of this project was focused around spreading information about the status of the virus that has greatly affected the lives of many in the world. 
The spread of scientifically supported information is extremley important to not only be as accurate as possible with spreading knowledge, but also to challenge any form of missinformation that can hinder the progress that needs to be made in combatting this global crisis.
